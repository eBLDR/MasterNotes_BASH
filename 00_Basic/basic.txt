.sh file is a Bourne shell script. Shell is an interface between the user and
the kernel.
Shell scripts are used in many variations of UNIX-like operating systems, they
have no "language"and are interpreted by the shell (interpreter of terminal
commands) or if the first line (shebang line) is in the form:

#!/path/to/interpreter

The script will use that particular interpreter. Usually, your file has the
shebang line:

	#!/bin/bash

or

	#!/usr/bin/env bash

and that means that it uses Bourne Again Shell, so called BASH.

";" represents a line feed, both equivalent.
"\" represents line continuation.
