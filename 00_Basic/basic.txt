.sh file is a Bourne shell script. Shell scripts are used in many variations of UNIX-like operating systems.
They have no "language" and are interpreted by the shell (interpreter of terminal commands) or if the first line (shebang line) is in the form:

#!/path/to/interpreter

The script will use that particular interpreter. Usually, your file has the shebang line:

	#!/bin/bash

or

	#!/usr/bin/env bash

and that means that it uses Bourne Again Shell, so called BASH.

";" represents a line feed, both equivalent.
"\" represents line continuation.
